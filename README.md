### Description

I was sick of people telling that VB cannot be used for a true client server application that too on the internet, Check this Server Client, this is a must see for advanced programmers.

The client connects to the server and databases even if on the net for both MS SQL &amp; MS Access Databases.

Can fetch more than 100,000 records and can upload/download files.

The server can also send startup mails to configured e-mails id; useful if the server is a dial up machine....

A must see by any ways...Dont forget to vote for me.... I need your comments &amp; suggestions too!!!

So hows it doing ?????

Guys....I need your vote / comments to review the performance of the software...if you have any queries pls feel free to email me at : bijo_mathew@hotmail.com
